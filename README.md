#  Homelab

Homelab is the playground that every IT professional should own. This is the place where you can gain valuable knowledge and where you can make mistakes in order to grow your skillset.        
There isn't any particular rule as to what a homelab should look like, the main point is to do what interests you and break as many things (and then repair them) as you can.        

I hope that someone will find this repo useful in creating their own tech playground.
